**TIME ATTACK MODE!**

You have 60 seconds to complete all 5 calculations.
The clock is ticking - can you beat the timer?

Your mission:
1. Calculate result1 = 15 + 27
2. Calculate result2 = 100 - 37
3. Calculate result3 = 8 * 12
4. Calculate result4 = 144 / 12
5. Calculate result5 = (result1 + result2) * 2

Print all 5 results!

# Self-teaching note:
#
# This demonstrates time_attack mode where the timer matters!
# Good for:
# - Building typing speed
# - Quick mental math
# - Getting comfortable with Python syntax
#
# The pressure is designed to be fun, not frustrating.
# If someone finds it stressful, they can do standard challenges instead.
