Time to have fun with strings!

Mad Libs is a game where you fill in blanks to create silly stories.

Your mission:
1. Create variables for: adjective, noun, verb, place
2. Combine them into this story:
   "The ADJECTIVE NOUN VERB to the PLACE"

Example: "The silly cat danced to the moon"

Use any method: f-strings, + operator, whatever works!

verb = ...

# Build your story using this exact template:
# "The ADJECTIVE NOUN VERB to the PLACE"
# Example: "The silly cat danced to the moon"

Two solutions:

Method 1 (f-string - recommended):
```python
adjective = "silly"
noun = "cat"
verb = "danced"
place = "moon"
story = f"The {adjective} {noun} {verb} to the {place}"
print(story)
```

Method 2 (concatenation):
```python
story = "The " + adjective + " " + noun + " " + verb + " to the " + place
print(story)
```

2. Use f-string: f"The {adjective} {noun}..."
3. Don't forget spaces between words!

📖 Story generated! String magic working!

🎨 String wizard unlocked!

You just built a text generator!
Change the variables, get infinite stories.

This is how:
- Chatbots generate responses
- Games create dialogue
- Apps personalize messages

You're manipulating reality with text now.

# Self-teaching note:
#
# This file demonstrates:
# - String concatenation (Level 1)
# - f-strings (Level 1)
# - Multiple string variables (Level 1)
# - Template-based generation (professional pattern)
#
# The learner discovers that code can be creative and fun.
