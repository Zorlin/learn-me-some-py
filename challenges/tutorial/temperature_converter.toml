Let's build something USEFUL - a temperature converter!

The formula: Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) × 5/9

Your mission:
1. Create a variable 'fahrenheit' and set it to 98.6
2. Convert it to Celsius using the formula
3. Print the Celsius temperature (rounded to 1 decimal place)

Tip: Use round(number, 1) to round to 1 decimal place!

Complete solution:
```python
fahrenheit = 98.6
celsius = round((fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9, 1)
print(celsius)
```

Order of operations matters!
Parentheses ensure we subtract BEFORE multiplying.

🎓 YOU BUILT SOMETHING REAL!

Not just toy examples - actual useful code.
This converter could go in a real app.

Real developers start here, then build empires.

How's it feel to build real tools?
