Python is an incredible calculator. Let's prove it!

Your mission:
1. Create a variable called 'result'
2. Calculate 42 + 58
3. Print the result

Computers are REALLY good at math. This is where they shine.

Complete solution:

Notice: No quotes around numbers!
Numbers without quotes = math
Numbers with quotes = just text

🧮 Math mode activated!

Python operators you now know:
+ (addition)
- (subtraction)
* (multiplication)
/ (division)

You're building computational thinking!
