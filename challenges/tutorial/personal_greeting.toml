Now let's make it personal!

Instead of greeting the whole world, let's greet YOU specifically.

You'll learn about VARIABLES - named containers that hold data.
Think of them like labeled boxes where you can store information.

Create a variable called 'name', put your name in it, then print a greeting.

Example outputs that would work:
- "Hello Ben"
- "Hello, Ben!"
- "hello Ben"

As long as your greeting includes "Hello" and your name, you're good!

# Store your name in a variable
name = "YourName"

# Print a greeting using your name
# Hint: combine "Hello " with your name variable using +
print(name)

Two ways to solve this:

Method 1 (concatenation):
```python
name = "Alice"
print("Hello " + name)
```

Method 2 (f-string - more flexible!):
```python
name = "Alice"
print(f"Hello {name}")
```

Both work! The exact punctuation doesn't matter - experiment!

🎮 CONTROLLER GUIDE:
1. Create your variable: name = "YourName"
2. Press RB for the + symbol to join text
3. Print: "Hello, " + name + "!"

Pro tip: The + symbol glues text together!

✨ Variables unlocked! You can now store and reuse data.

This is HUGE. Variables are the foundation of all programming.
You just leveled up.

How's it feeling?

# Self-teaching note:

# This file demonstrates:
# - Variables (Level 0)
# - Assignment with = operator (Level 0)
# - String concatenation or f-strings (Level 0-1)
# - Personalization creates engagement
#
# The learner discovers that programs can remember things.
