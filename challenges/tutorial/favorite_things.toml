Let's build a personal profile!

You'll work with MULTIPLE variables at once - just like real programs do.

Your mission:
1. Create these variables:
   - name (your name)
   - age (a number)
   - hobby (something you enjoy)
2. Print them in a nice format

Output should be: "NAME is AGE years old and loves HOBBY"

🎭 Multi-variable mastery!

You just managed state across multiple variables.
This is what real programs do - juggle lots of data at once.

You're thinking like a developer now:
✓ Different data types (strings, numbers)
✓ Multiple variables
✓ Formatted output

[RT] I'm getting it! | [LT] More practice? | [Y] What's next?

# Self-teaching note:
#
# This file demonstrates:
# - Multiple variables (Level 1)
# - Type awareness (strings vs numbers) (Level 1)
# - f-strings with multiple variables (Level 1)
# - State management (professional concept)
#
# The learner discovers that programs manage complex data.
