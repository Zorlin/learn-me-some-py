Time to make your program INTERACTIVE!

You've been printing output. Now let's get INPUT from the user!

Your mission:
1. Set a secret number (like 42)
2. Ask the user to guess using input()
3. Compare their guess to your number
4. Print "correct" if they match, "wrong" if they don't

This is your first interactive program!

# Ask the user to guess - use input() to get their answer
# Remember: input() returns text, but we need a number!

# Compare guess to secret:
# - If they match, print "correct"
# - Otherwise, print "wrong"

Complete solution:
```python
secret = 42
guess = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if guess == secret:
    print("correct")
else:
    print("wrong")
```

Key concepts:
- input() gets text from user
- int() converts text to number
- == checks if two things are equal
- if/else makes decisions

🚀 GAME DEVELOPER UNLOCKED!

You just built an interactive game!

Let that sink in:
✓ User input
✓ Conditional logic
✓ Interactive feedback

Every game, app, and tool does these three things.
You just learned the foundation of ALL interactive software.

This is HUGE.

How does it feel to build something interactive?

# Self-teaching note:

# This file demonstrates:
# - input() function (Level 1)
# - Type conversion with int() (Level 1)
# - Comparison operators (==) (Level 1)
# - if/else conditionals (Level 1)
# - Interactive programs (professional milestone)
#
# The learner discovers that programs can respond to users.
# This is the gateway to game development, apps, and interactivity.
