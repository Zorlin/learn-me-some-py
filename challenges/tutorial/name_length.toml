Python has superpowers built in - they're called "functions".

You've used print() and round(). Now meet len()!

len() tells you how many characters are in a string.

Your mission:
1. Create a variable 'name' with any name
2. Find its length using len()
3. Print: "Your name has X letters"

Replace X with the actual length!

Complete solution:

len() works on any string - it counts the characters!

🔧 Function unlocked: len()

Python has HUNDREDS of built-in functions.
Each one is a tool in your toolbox.

You just learned how to:
- Call functions
- Pass them arguments
- Use their results

Every expert function user started here.

[RT] I love built-ins! | [LT] Show me more | [Y] What other functions exist?

# Self-teaching note:
#
# This file demonstrates:
# - Built-in functions (Level 1)
# - len() function specifically (Level 1)
# - Function arguments and return values (Level 1)
# - f-strings with variables (Level 1)
#
# The learner discovers that Python gives them ready-made tools.
