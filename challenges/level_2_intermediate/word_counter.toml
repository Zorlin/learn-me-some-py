You're building a text analyzer to find the most common words.

Given a list of words, count how many times each word appears.
Return results as commands:
- COUNT <word>: Return the count for that word as a string
- MOST: Return the most frequent word
- TOTAL: Return total number of unique words

Example:
Input: ["hello", "world", "hello"]
Commands: ["COUNT hello", "COUNT world", "MOST", "TOTAL"]
Output: ["2", "1", "hello", "2"]
