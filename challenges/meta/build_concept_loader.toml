You're building a piece of LMSP itself!

The concept loader reads TOML files like this one and turns them into Python objects
that the game engine can use. Every concept in LMSP - from variables to classes to
comprehensions - starts as a TOML file and gets loaded by the code YOU'RE ABOUT TO WRITE.

Implement a concept loader that:
- Reads a TOML file from disk
- Parses the structure into a Concept dataclass
- Validates that prerequisites exist
- Returns the loaded concept

This is META. You're building the system that taught you.
