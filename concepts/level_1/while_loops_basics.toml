## Keep Going Until...

While loops keep running until a condition becomes False:

```python
lives = 3
while lives > 0:
    print(f"Lives: {lives}")
    lives -= 1
print("Game Over!")

# Output:
# Lives: 3
# Lives: 2
# Lives: 1
# Game Over!
```

## For vs While

- **For loops**: When you know how many times (loop 10 times)
- **While loops**: Until something happens (until player quits)

## The Classic Pattern

```python
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1  # DON'T FORGET THIS!
print("Blast off!")
```

## ⚠️ DANGER: Infinite Loops!

If the condition never becomes False, the loop runs FOREVER:

```python
# INFINITE LOOP - DON'T DO THIS!
x = 5
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    # Forgot to decrease x! Loop never ends!
```

## Breaking Out Early

Use `break` to exit a loop immediately:

```python
while True:  # Looks infinite, but...
    answer = input("Type 'quit' to exit: ")
    if answer == "quit":
        break  # Exits the loop!
print("Goodbye!")
```

## Skip to Next Iteration

Use `continue` to skip the rest of the current iteration:

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    count += 1
    if count == 3:
        continue  # Skip printing 3
    print(count)
# Output: 1, 2, 4, 5 (no 3!)
```
