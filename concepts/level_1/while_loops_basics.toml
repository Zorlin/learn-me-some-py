brief = "Repeat code while a condition is True"

While loops keep going until something changes. Unlike for loops (which loop
a specific number of times), while loops run until their condition becomes False.

```python
lives = 3
while lives > 0:
    print(f"Lives remaining: {lives}")
    lives -= 1
print("Game Over!")
```

Perfect for game loops, user input, and "until done" situations.
