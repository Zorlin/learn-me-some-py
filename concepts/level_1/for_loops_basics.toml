A for loop lets you do the same thing multiple times without copy-pasting code.

```python
# Without a loop (tedious!)
print("Player 1")
print("Player 2")
print("Player 3")

# With a loop (elegant!)
for i in range(1, 4):
    print(f"Player {i}")
```

For loops are your best friend for repetitive tasks.

[examples]
basic = """
# Loop through numbers
for num in range(5):

# Loop through a string
for letter in "HELLO":
    print(letter)  # Prints H, E, L, L, O

# Loop with both index and value
