## Stop Copy-Pasting!

A for loop lets you do the same thing multiple times:

```python
# Without a loop (tedious!)
print("Player 1")
print("Player 2")
print("Player 3")

# With a loop (elegant!)
for i in range(1, 4):
    print(f"Player {i}")
```

## The range() Function

`range()` generates sequences of numbers:

```python
range(5)        # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (starts at 0!)
range(1, 6)     # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (stops BEFORE 6!)
range(0, 10, 2) # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (step by 2)
```

## Loop Through Numbers

```python
for num in range(5):
    print(num)
# Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

## Loop Through Strings

```python
for letter in "HELLO":
    print(letter)
# Output: H, E, L, L, O (one per line)
```

## The Loop Variable

The variable after `for` gets each value:

```python
for fruit in ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")
# I like apple
# I like banana
# I like cherry
```

## Common Gotcha: Off By One

```python
# WRONG: range(5) goes 0-4, not 1-5!
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# RIGHT: range(1, 6) goes 1-5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)  # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

## The Underscore Trick

If you don't need the loop variable:

```python
# Just do something 3 times
for _ in range(3):
    print("Hip hip hooray!")
```
