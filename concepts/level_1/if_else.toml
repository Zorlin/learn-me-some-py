## The Fork in the Road

Sometimes code needs to make decisions. `if/else` is like a fork in the road - your code takes ONE path, never both.

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")
else:
    print("Not old enough yet")
```

## The Rules

1. **Colon required** - `if condition:` must end with `:`
2. **Indentation matters** - Code inside must be indented (4 spaces)
3. **else is optional** - You can have just `if`

## Simple Decisions

```python
is_raining = True
if is_raining:
    print("Bring an umbrella")
else:
    print("Enjoy the sunshine")
```

## Comparisons Return Booleans

```python
x = 5
print(x > 3)   # True
print(x == 10) # False (double equals for comparison!)
print(x != 3)  # True (not equal)
```

## Watch Out!

```python
# WRONG - single equals is assignment, not comparison!
if x = 5:    # This is an ERROR

# RIGHT - double equals for comparison
if x == 5:   # This checks if x equals 5
```

## Truthiness

Python treats some values as False:
- `0`, `0.0` (zero)
- `""` (empty string)
- `[]` (empty list)
- `None`

Everything else is True!

```python
lives = 0
if lives:
    print("Keep playing")
else:
    print("Game over")  # This runs because 0 is "falsy"
```
