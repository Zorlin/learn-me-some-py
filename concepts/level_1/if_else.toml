# Level 1: If/Else - Making Decisions

Every game needs decisions. Can the player afford that sword? Is the enemy in range?
Did they guess the right number?

`if/else` lets your code take ONE of two paths - never both. It's the foundation
of all game logic: checking conditions and reacting appropriately.

## The Basic Pattern

```python
health = 0

if health <= 0:
    print("Game Over!")
else:
    print("Still alive!")
```

**The structure:**
1. `if` followed by a **condition** (something True or False)
2. A **colon** `:`
3. **Indented** code that runs if True
4. `else:` for the alternative path
5. **Indented** code that runs if False

## Comparison Operators

Use these to compare values:

| Operator | Meaning                  | Example          |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------|
| `>=`     | greater than or equal    | `score >= 100`   |
| `>`      | greater than             | `lives > 0`      |
| `==`     | equal to (TWO equals!)   | `level == 5`     |
| `!=`     | not equal to             | `enemy != "boss"`|
| `<`      | less than                | `ammo < 10`      |
| `<=`     | less than or equal       | `time <= 0`      |

## Common Mistake: = vs ==

```python
# WRONG - single = is assignment!
if level = 5:    # ERROR!

# RIGHT - double == is comparison
if level == 5:   # Checks if level equals 5
    print("Boss fight!")
```

## Both Paths Must Print Something

When checking if a player can afford something, tell them the result either way:
- **If yes:** Let them know the purchase worked
- **If no:** Let them know they need more
