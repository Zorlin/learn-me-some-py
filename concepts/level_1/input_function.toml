input() pauses your program and waits for the user to type something.
Whatever they type becomes a string you can use!

```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# When run:
# What's your name? Archer
# Hello, Archer!

input() ALWAYS returns a string, even if they type a number!
