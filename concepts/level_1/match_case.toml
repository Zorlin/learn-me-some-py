## Cleaner Than if/elif/else

When checking one value against many possibilities, `match/case` is cleaner:

```python
command = input("What do? ")
match command:
    case "go":
        print("You venture forth")
    case "look":
        print("You see a room")
    case "quit":
        print("Goodbye!")
    case _:
        print("Unknown command")
```

The underscore `_` is the catch-all (like `else`).

## HTTP Status Codes

```python
status = 404
match status:
    case 200:
        print("OK")
    case 404:
        print("Not Found")
    case 500:
        print("Server Error")
    case _:
        print("Unknown status")
```

## Multiple Values with |

```python
direction = input("Direction: ")
match direction:
    case "north" | "n":
        print("Going north")
    case "south" | "s":
        print("Going south")
    case "east" | "e":
        print("Going east")
    case "west" | "w":
        print("Going west")
    case _:
        print("Invalid direction")
```

## Key Differences from if/elif

1. **No break needed** - Only ONE case runs
2. **Cleaner syntax** - Less repetition
3. **Pattern matching** - Can match complex structures (advanced)

## ⚠️ Requires Python 3.10+

`match/case` is NEW in Python 3.10. If you get a syntax error, check your Python version:

```bash
python --version  # Should be 3.10 or higher
```

For older Python, use if/elif/else:

```python
# Same thing without match/case
if command == "go":
    print("You venture forth")
elif command == "look":
    print("You see a room")
else:
    print("Unknown command")
```
