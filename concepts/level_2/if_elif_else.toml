## More Than Two Choices

When you have multiple options, use `elif` (short for "else if"):

```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("B")  # This runs!
elif score >= 70:
    print("C")
else:
    print("F")
```

## How It Works

1. Python checks each condition **in order**
2. **Only the first** True condition runs
3. Once one runs, the rest are **skipped**
4. `else` catches anything that didn't match

```python
x = 50

if x > 10:
    print("A")   # This runs (first True)
elif x > 25:
    print("B")   # Skipped! Even though x > 25
elif x > 40:
    print("C")   # Skipped!
```

## Order Matters!

Put specific conditions first, general ones later:

```python
# WRONG - 90+ never reached!
if score >= 70:
    print("C or better")
elif score >= 90:
    print("A")  # Never runs!

# RIGHT - most specific first
if score >= 90:
    print("A")
elif score >= 70:
    print("C or better")
```

## Multiple Independent Checks

Use separate `if` statements when they're not mutually exclusive:

```python
# Using elif - only ONE can run
if hp < 20:
    print("Low HP!")
elif mp < 20:
    print("Low MP!")  # Won't show if hp < 20!

# Using separate if - BOTH can run
if hp < 20:
    print("Low HP!")
if mp < 20:
    print("Low MP!")
```

## Nested Conditionals

You can nest if statements:

```python
if has_key:
    if door_locked:
        print("Unlocking...")
    else:
        print("Door already open")
else:
    print("Need a key!")
```

Often cleaner with `and`:

```python
if has_key and door_locked:
    print("Unlocking...")
elif has_key and not door_locked:
    print("Door already open")
else:
    print("Need a key!")
```

## The Ternary Expression

One-line if/else for simple cases:

```python
status = "alive" if hp > 0 else "dead"
print(status)
```
