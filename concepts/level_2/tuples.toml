## Lists That Can't Change

A tuple is like a sealed envelope - once you create it, you can't change what's inside. Use parentheses `()` instead of brackets `[]`.

```python
position = (10, 20)      # A tuple with 2 items
print(position[0])       # 10 (can read)
# position[0] = 15       # ERROR! Can't modify
```

## Why Use Tuples?

1. **Safety** - Data can't be accidentally changed
2. **Dictionary keys** - Lists can't be dict keys, tuples can
3. **Multiple return values** - Functions often return tuples
4. **Slightly faster** - Less memory than lists

## Creating Tuples

```python
# With parentheses
point = (5, 10)
rgb = (255, 128, 0)

# Single item needs trailing comma!
single = (42,)     # Tuple with one item
not_tuple = (42)   # Just the number 42 in parentheses!

# Without parentheses (also valid)
coords = 1, 2, 3   # Tuple (1, 2, 3)
```

## Tuple Unpacking

Pull values out into separate variables:

```python
point = (100, 200)
x, y = point
print(x)  # 100
print(y)  # 200

# Works with any iterable!
first, second, third = [1, 2, 3]

# Swap variables elegantly
a, b = b, a
```

## As Dictionary Keys

Lists can't be dictionary keys, but tuples can:

```python
# Game grid with coordinates
grid = {}
grid[(0, 0)] = "spawn"
grid[(5, 3)] = "treasure"

print(grid[(0, 0)])  # "spawn"
```

## Common Mistake: The Single-Item Tuple

```python
# WRONG - just a number
single = (42)
print(type(single))  # <class 'int'>

# RIGHT - tuple with one item
single = (42,)       # Note the comma!
print(type(single))  # <class 'tuple'>
```
