A tuple is like a sealed envelope - once you create it, you can't change what's inside.
Use parentheses () instead of brackets [].

```python
coordinates = (10, 20)          # A tuple with 2 items
print(coordinates[0])           # 10 (can read)
# coordinates[0] = 15           # ERROR! Can't modify

# Single item needs trailing comma
single = (42,)                  # Tuple
not_tuple = (42)                # Just a number in parens
