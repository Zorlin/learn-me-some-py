## The Problem

When you try to access a key that doesn't exist, Python crashes:

```python
scores = {"alice": 95, "bob": 87}
print(scores["charlie"])  # KeyError: 'charlie'
```

This is called a **KeyError** - the key isn't in the dictionary.

## The Solution: Check First

Use `in` to check if a key exists before accessing it:

```python
scores = {"alice": 95, "bob": 87}

if "charlie" in scores:
    print(scores["charlie"])
else:
    print("Not found")
```

The `in` keyword returns `True` if the key exists, `False` if it doesn't.

## Common Pattern: Counting

When counting things, you need to handle "first time seen":

```python
counts = {}

word = "cat"
if word in counts:
    counts[word] += 1  # Already exists, add 1
else:
    counts[word] = 1   # First time, start at 1
```

This is the **check-then-act** pattern. You'll use it constantly.
