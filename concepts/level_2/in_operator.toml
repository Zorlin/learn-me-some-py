## Is This Thing Here?

The `in` operator checks if something exists in a container:

```python
inventory = ["sword", "shield", "potion"]

if "sword" in inventory:
    print("Ready for battle!")

if "map" not in inventory:
    print("Need to find a map")
```

## Works Everywhere

```python
# Lists
print("apple" in ["apple", "banana"])  # True

# Strings (checks substrings!)
print("cat" in "catch")    # True
print("dog" in "catch")    # False

# Dictionaries (checks KEYS, not values!)
player = {"name": "Alex", "level": 5}
print("name" in player)    # True (key exists)
print("Alex" in player)    # False (that's a value!)
print("Alex" in player.values())  # True

# Sets (super fast!)
valid = {"go", "look", "take"}
print("go" in valid)       # True
```

## not in

Check if something is missing:

```python
if "poison" not in inventory:
    print("Safe to drink!")
```

## Performance Tip

`in` with **sets** is much faster than with lists:

```python
# Slow for big lists (checks each item)
if x in huge_list:  # O(n)

# Fast with sets (instant lookup)
if x in huge_set:   # O(1)

# Convert if checking many times
items_set = set(items_list)
for thing in many_things:
    if thing in items_set:  # Fast!
        print("Found!")
```

## Common Patterns

```python
# Validate input
valid_commands = {"attack", "defend", "run", "quit"}
command = input("Command: ").lower()
if command in valid_commands:
    process(command)
else:
    print("Unknown command")

# Check before accessing
if "health" in player_stats:
    print(player_stats["health"])
```
