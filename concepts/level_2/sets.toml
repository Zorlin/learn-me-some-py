## No Duplicates Allowed

A set automatically removes duplicates. Great for tracking unique things.

```python
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}  # Duplicates removed!
print(numbers)             # {1, 2, 3}
```

## Creating Sets

```python
# With curly braces (but NOT empty - that's a dict!)
colors = {"red", "green", "blue"}

# Empty set (must use set())
empty = set()

# From a list (removes duplicates)
names = ["alice", "bob", "alice"]
unique_names = set(names)  # {"alice", "bob"}
```

## Adding and Removing

```python
visited = {"forest", "cave"}

# Add one item
visited.add("town")

# Remove (error if missing)
visited.remove("cave")

# Remove (no error if missing)
visited.discard("mountain")  # Silent if not found
```

## Fast Membership Testing

Sets are **super fast** at checking "is this in here?":

```python
valid_commands = {"go", "look", "take", "quit"}

command = input("Command: ")
if command in valid_commands:  # Instant lookup!
    print("Valid!")
```

For large collections, `in` with sets is much faster than lists.

## Set Operations

```python
players_a = {"alice", "bob", "carol"}
players_b = {"bob", "dave", "eve"}

# Who plays both? (intersection)
both = players_a & players_b  # {"bob"}

# All players (union)
all_players = players_a | players_b  # {"alice", "bob", "carol", "dave", "eve"}

# Only in A (difference)
only_a = players_a - players_b  # {"alice", "carol"}
```

## Watch Out!

```python
# Empty set is NOT {} (that's a dict!)
empty_dict = {}
empty_set = set()

# No indexing!
s = {1, 2, 3}
s[0]  # TypeError! Sets have no order
```
