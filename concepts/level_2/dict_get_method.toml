## The Verbose Way

You learned to check if a key exists first:

```python
counts = {}
word = "cat"

if word in counts:
    counts[word] += 1
else:
    counts[word] = 1
```

This works, but it's 4 lines for a simple operation.

## The Shortcut: .get()

The `.get()` method returns a **default value** if the key doesn't exist:

```python
scores = {"alice": 95, "bob": 87}

print(scores.get("alice", 0))    # 95 (found)
print(scores.get("charlie", 0))  # 0  (not found, use default)
```

Syntax: `dict.get(key, default_value)`

## Counting in One Line

That 4-line counting pattern becomes 1 line:

```python
counts = {}
word = "cat"

counts[word] = counts.get(word, 0) + 1
```

**How it works:**
1. `counts.get(word, 0)` returns the current count, or 0 if new
2. We add 1 to it
3. We store the result back

## When to Use Each

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Need to do different things for found/not-found | `if key in dict` |
| Just need a default value | `.get(key, default)` |
| Counting things | `.get(key, 0) + 1` |

**The explicit `if/else` is always valid.** `.get()` is just a shortcut for common cases.
