## Arithmetic Operators

```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)    # 13  (addition)
print(a - b)    # 7   (subtraction)
print(a * b)    # 30  (multiplication)
print(a / b)    # 3.33... (division)
print(a // b)   # 3   (integer division)
print(a % b)    # 1   (remainder/modulo)
print(a ** b)   # 1000 (power: 10^3)
```

## Comparison Operators

These return `True` or `False`:

```python
x = 5
y = 10

print(x == y)   # False (equal?)
print(x != y)   # True  (not equal?)
print(x < y)    # True  (less than?)
print(x > y)    # False (greater than?)
print(x <= y)   # True  (less or equal?)
print(x >= y)   # False (greater or equal?)
```

## Assignment Shortcuts

```python
score = 100
score += 10    # Same as: score = score + 10
score -= 5     # Same as: score = score - 5
score *= 2     # Same as: score = score * 2

print(score)   # 210
```

## String Operators

```python
# + joins strings
greeting = "Hello" + " " + "World"

# * repeats strings
stars = "*" * 5   # "*****"
```
