brief = "Do math in Python with familiar symbols"
detailed = """
Python uses symbols for math operations:

```python
x = 10 + 5    # Addition: 15
y = 10 - 5    # Subtraction: 5
z = 10 * 5    # Multiplication: 50
a = 10 / 5    # Division: 2.0
b = 10 % 3    # Modulo (remainder): 1
```

Most are familiar, but % might be new!
"""

[operators]
addition = """
+ adds numbers together

score = 100
bonus = 50
total = score + bonus  # 150

Also works on strings! "Hello" + "World" = "HelloWorld"
"""

subtraction = """
- subtracts numbers

health = 100
damage = 25
remaining = health - damage  # 75

Can make negative numbers: 10 - 20 = -10
"""

multiplication = """
* multiplies numbers

damage = 10
multiplier = 2
total_damage = damage * multiplier  # 20

Also works on strings! "Ha" * 3 = "HaHaHa"
"""

division = """
/ divides numbers (always returns float)

total = 10
count = 4
average = total / count  # 2.5

Remember: Division by zero crashes! 10 / 0 is an error.
"""

modulo = """
% gives the REMAINDER after division

print(10 % 3)   # 1 (10 ÷ 3 = 3 remainder 1)
print(15 % 4)   # 3 (15 ÷ 4 = 3 remainder 3)
print(20 % 5)   # 0 (20 ÷ 5 = 4 remainder 0)

Super useful for:
- Checking if a number is even: x % 2 == 0
- Wrapping around (like a clock): hour % 12
- Alternating patterns: if index % 2 == 0
"""

rules = """
Python follows PEMDAS (just like math class):
1. Parentheses ()
2. Exponents ** (we'll learn this later)
3. Multiplication * and Division /
4. Addition + and Subtraction -

Left to right for same level!
"""
examples = '''
# Without parentheses
result = 5 + 3 * 2    # 11 (not 16!)
# 3 * 2 happens first (6), then + 5

# With parentheses
result = (5 + 3) * 2  # 16
# 5 + 3 happens first (8), then * 2
'''

[gotchas]
division_by_zero = """
NEVER divide by zero!

x = 10 / 0  # ERROR! ZeroDivisionError

Always check if your divisor might be zero.
"""
integer_division = """
/ always gives you a float, even for whole numbers:

print(10 / 2)   # 5.0 (float!)
print(9 / 3)    # 3.0 (float!)

Want an integer? Use // (we'll learn this later)
"""
modulo_negative = """
Modulo with negative numbers can be surprising:

print(-10 % 3)   # 2 (not -1!)

The sign matches the divisor (right side). Usually avoid with negatives.
"""
string_multiplication = """
* works on strings, but + is careful:

"Hi" * 3         # "HiHiHi" ✓
"Hi" + " there"  # "Hi there" ✓
"Hi" + 3         # ERROR! Can't add string and number
