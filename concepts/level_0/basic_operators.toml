Operators are the verbs of programming - they DO things with your data.

You already know variables hold data. But data just sitting there is useless. Operators let you:

- **Do math**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` work like a calculator
- **Compare things**: `>`, `<`, `==` ask questions and get `True` or `False`
- **Update values**: `-=` subtracts AND saves in one step

In games, operators power everything: damage calculations, health checks, score updates. Without operators, your variables would just sit there doing nothing.

## Your Mission

1. Create a variable `health` set to 100
2. Create a variable `damage` set to 25
3. Subtract damage from health using `-=`
4. Create a variable `is_alive` that checks if health > 0
5. Print both the final health AND whether you're alive

**Expected output:**
```
75
True
```

## The `-=` Shortcut

Instead of `health = health - damage`, use:

```python
health -= damage
```

## Storing a Comparison

Comparisons return `True` or `False`. You can save the result:

```python
is_alive = health > 0   # is_alive becomes True or False
```
