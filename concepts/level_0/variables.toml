A variable is like a labeled box. You put something in it, and you can
use that label to get it back later.

```python
health = 100        # Create a variable named 'health'
name = "Player"     # Variables can hold text too
print(health)       # Output: 100
print(name)         # Output: Player
```

Variables remember things for you!
