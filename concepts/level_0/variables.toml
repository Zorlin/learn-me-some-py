## What's a Variable?

A variable is like a labeled box. You put something in it, and use the label to get it back.

```python
health = 100        # Create a variable named 'health'
name = "Player"     # Variables can hold text too

print(health)       # Output: 100
print(name)         # Output: Player
```

## Naming Rules

**Good names (snake_case is Pythonic!):**
```python
player_health = 100
high_score = 9999
is_alive = True
```

**Bad names (these break!):**
```python
123score = 0        # Can't start with number
my-variable = 5     # No hyphens! Use underscores
my variable = 5     # No spaces!
```

## Variables Can Change

```python
lives = 3
lives = lives - 1   # Now lives is 2
print(lives)        # Output: 2
```

## Python is Case-Sensitive!

```python
health = 100
Health = 200    # This is a DIFFERENT variable!
```
