brief = "Every value in Python has a type"

Just like in real life, different things work differently.
You can add numbers, but you concatenate strings.

```python
age = 25              # int (whole number)
height = 5.9          # float (decimal number)
name = "Alex"         # str (text)
is_learning = True    # bool (True or False)
nothing = None        # None (absence of value)
```

Python knows the difference and won't let you mix them wrong.
