brief = "Work with whole numbers (int) and decimal numbers (float)"
detailed = """
Python has two main types of numbers:

**Integers (int)** - Whole numbers
```python
lives = 3
score = 1000
level = 1
```

**Floats (float)** - Numbers with decimal points
```python
health = 95.5
speed = 2.3
temperature = -40.0
```

Both work with math operations!

Whole numbers: ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

count = 10

floats = """
Decimal numbers: 3.14, -0.5, 100.0

basic_math = '''
x = 10
y = 3

addition = x + y      # 13
subtraction = x - y   # 7
multiplication = x * y # 30
division = x / y      # 3.333... (always float!)
'''

[gotchas]
division_always_float = """
Division ALWAYS returns a float, even if it divides evenly:

print(10 / 2)   # 5.0 (not 5!)
print(7 / 2)    # 3.5

This is different from some other languages!
"""
integer_vs_float = """
Adding int + float gives you float:

x = 5        # int
y = 2.5      # float
z = x + y    # 7.5 (float!)

Python automatically converts when needed.
"""
float_precision = """
Floats are approximate (computer limitation):

print(0.1 + 0.2)  # 0.30000000000000004

This is true in ALL programming languages! It's how computers work.
For money, use integers (cents) or specialized libraries.
