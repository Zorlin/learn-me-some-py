## Your First Superpower

`print()` displays text on the screen. It's how you make Python talk!

```python
print("Hello, World!")    # Output: Hello, World!
print("I'm learning!")    # Output: I'm learning!
print(42)                 # Output: 42
```

You can print text (strings), numbers, or anything Python knows about.

## The Rules

**Strings need quotes!** Either "double" or 'single' quotes work.

```python
print("Hello")     # Correct
print(Hello)       # Error! Python looks for a variable named Hello
```

**Don't forget parentheses!**

```python
print("Hi")        # Correct
print "Hi"         # Error! This was old Python 2 syntax
```

## Pro Tip

You can print multiple things separated by commas:

```python
print("Hello", "World")   # Output: Hello World
print("Score:", 100)      # Output: Score: 100
```
