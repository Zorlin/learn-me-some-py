print() is your first superpower. It displays text on the screen.

```python
print("Hello, World!")    # Output: Hello, World!
print("I'm learning!")    # Output: I'm learning!
print(42)                 # Output: 42
```

You can print text (strings), numbers, or anything Python knows about.

Strings need quotes! Either "double" or 'single' quotes work.

Don't forget the parentheses! In Python 3, print is a function.
