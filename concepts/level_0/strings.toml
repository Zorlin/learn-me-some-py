Strings are how Python handles text. Wrap text in quotes and you've got a string!

```python
greeting = "Hello!"
message = 'Welcome to Python'
story = "Once upon a time..."

print(greeting)   # Output: Hello!
```

Single quotes 'like this' or double quotes "like this" both work!

Quotes must match!

Use different quotes when you need quotes inside:

✓ "It's working!"      # Single quote inside double
✓ 'He said "Hi"'       # Double quotes inside single
