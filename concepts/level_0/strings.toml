## Text in Python

Strings are how Python handles text. Wrap text in quotes and you've got a string!

```python
greeting = "Hello!"
message = 'Welcome to Python'

print(greeting)   # Output: Hello!
```

Single quotes `'like this'` or double quotes `"like this"` both work!

## Combining Strings

**Join strings with +**
```python
first = "Hello"
second = "World"
combined = first + " " + second
print(combined)   # Output: Hello World
```

**Repeat strings with ***
```python
laugh = "ha" * 3
print(laugh)      # Output: hahaha
```

## Watch Out!

**Quotes must match:**
```python
"Hello"     # Good - both double
'Hello'     # Good - both single
"Hello'     # Error - mismatched!
```

**Strings aren't numbers:**
```python
age_number = 25
age_string = "25"

print(age_number + 5)    # 30 (math!)
print(age_string + "5")  # "255" (text join!)
```
