## What Are Comments?

Comments are notes YOU can read, but Python ignores them.
They explain WHAT you're doing and WHY.

```python
# This is a comment - Python skips it!
health = 100  # You can comment after code too

# Comments help you remember what your code does
# They're like notes in the margins of a book
```

Use `#` to start a comment. Everything after `#` on that line is ignored.

## When to Use Comments

**GOOD: Explain WHY you did something**
```python
# Give player double points on their birthday
score = base_score * 2
```

**GOOD: Mark things to fix later**
```python
# TODO: Add sound effects here
# BUG: This breaks when health is negative
# FIXME: Optimize this loop later
```

**BAD: Don't state the obvious**
```python
# Set x to 5  <- This adds nothing!
x = 5
```

## Pro Tips

- Write comments for yourself 6 months from now
- Good variable names often replace the need for comments
- When you change code, update its comments too!
