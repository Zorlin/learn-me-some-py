Comments are notes YOU can read, but Python ignores them.
They explain WHAT you're doing and WHY.

```python
# This is a comment - Python skips it!
health = 100  # You can comment after code too

# Comments help you remember what your code does
# They're like notes in the margins of a book
```

Use # to start a comment. Everything after # on that line is ignored.
